Set Up and Installation:

To set up and run this program on any Operating System:
1. Download the zip file and extract its contents. 

2. In order to turn in this project via email, we were instructed to add '.txt' to all of our JS files. There is only one JS file for this program. Locate 
   hexomino.js.txt and peice.js.txt and remove the '.txt' from their names. Save the files with these new names. 

3. Open the HTML file in any web browser. You can do this by simply double clicking the file or dragging the HTML file into your web browser window. 

4. That's it. The program should run in your browser with no issues as long as the hexomino.js, hexomino.html, peice.js, and style.css files are all in the same directory. 
   You should see the title and header appear and the animation should begin. 


Included Features:
Simulatneous animation of Gold's Poresort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort 

Bugs: NONE observed

Warning: Animation restarts if you hit the refresh button on your web browser.
